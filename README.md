# The-Big-Book-of-Small-Python-Projects
This is my repo following the book "The Big Book of Small Python Projects: 81 Easy Practice Programs" by Al Sweigart.

I will continuously be updating this repo as I create and work on each project. I will eventually update this readme to include more information, as well as any re-factors of applications I do.
